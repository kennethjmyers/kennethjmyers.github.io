Despite, or perhaps because of, having an abundance of information about me already readily available on the internet, I am actually not fond of putting information about putting too much information about myself on here. I've blogged and unblogged numerous times in the past and have do not currently have a Facebook. Therefore, I will be keeping my blog posts short on this site.

When I was first accepted to Metis, I was ecstatic. I could not wait to start the next chapter in my life. I got started on my prework immediately and progressed slowly, doing a few problems here and there, for the next few months. As time went on and the intervals between my submissions increased, I became afraid that I would get to the class bored and having lost interest in the material and my work.

I have discovered that my fears could not have been further from the truth. I've become so absorbed in my studies that I've actually found myself disinterested in most other distractions. If it isn't related to NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Seaborn or another library we're learning then I lose interest almost immediately. Unfortunately, in other ways my focus has become a problem for me as it's become an uphill struggle to not seem rude when I'm only half listening to anything that isn't related to data science.

This attention has become somewhat of a double-edged sword when it comes to group work. While I am able to focus on my code and get the work done, most often in advance of a deadline, I have become distant from my group partners and it is something that I will have to work on in the coming weeks. I think I'll try to help them with their work as I don't see slowing my pace as an alternative.

My own shortcomings aside, Metis has broadened my horizons faster than I had hoped. I feel that if I had tried to study on my own then I would not have made nearly as much progress in just a single week. With still so much room to grow I plan to tackle each week as if it was my first.
