## Hi!
Hello and thank you for checking out my blog! My name is Ken, I am 23, and from Long Island, New York. I'm currently living in NYC and attending Metis, a bootcamp in Manhattan. Metis is an intensive project-oriented curriculum.  Each project poses a question and I am responsible for gathering the necessary data and choosing the best methods of analysis to extract a solution.

## Background
Prior to Metis I was a Chemist working at Calmetrics, Inc. I created and certified X-ray fluorescence (XRF) standards used in the calibration of XRF machines. Before that I was a student at Stony Brook University Where I received a BS in Chemistry and Applied Mathematics and Statistics.

## Data
Whether I'm in a forest or analyzing data, I love exploring and learning about the world around me. This blog will be primarily focused on the data. Periodically I will make posts about the data science projects I'm working on, tutorials of something I don't find explained well enough, and occasionally just write about libraries I'm using. If I'm ever wrong about something or you want me to write about something, shoot me a message or write something in the comments.

I hope you enjoy my blog!
